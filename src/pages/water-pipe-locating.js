            Damaged water pipes can be very harmful as they are known to cause
            serious problems. For instance, if an underground water line is
            damaged or if thereâ€™s any break in the pipeline, water is released
            from the pipeline at high pressure which can propel debris from the
            pipe as well as surrounding materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such damaged water pipes are also capable of harming other
            underground services and infrastructures. They can do so directly or
            by eroding their materials upon washing away. This substantial
            involvement of water in utilities and structures is regarded as very
            harmful and can lead to a dangerous turn of events.
